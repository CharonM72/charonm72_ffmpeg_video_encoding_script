# charonm72_ffmpeg_video_encoding_script
 A simple-ish script for encoding videos. Mostly written with AI.

Run the script with `python video_encoder.py`. Needs the videos to encode in the same directory, so probably copy the script to where the videos are and run it there. Follow the prompts in the shell.
